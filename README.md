<h2>Starting the server</h2>

* <strong>npm install</strong> && <strong>npm start</strong> and you're good to go.

<h2>Connecting to the server</h2>

Enter <a href="localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a> in your browser.

<h2>Branch compatibility with browsers :</h2>

NB : Here the master branch is just a merge from the server branch, so using the server branch is equivalent to using the master branch.
The <strong>local</strong> branch is an alternative version of the application that is meant to be used locally which could be useful when no internet connection is available.
