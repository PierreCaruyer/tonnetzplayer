NB : Here the master branch is just a merge from the server branch, so using the server branch is equivalent to using the master branch.
The <strong>local</strong> branch is an alternative version of the application that is meant to be used locally which could be useful when no internet connection is available.
=======
<br>No server is required to used this branch is meant to be used locally only.</br>
<br>Using this version of the application might require <strong>moving your .mid file in the same directory</strong> as the application.</br>
<br>Then you can play your .mid file.</br>
